# Silverstripe SortWeight Module TODO
  * Create up and down button (similar to existing top/bottom - but shifts up 1 or down one. Very useful when sorting objects in tables with multiple pages.
  * Make compatible with DataObjectManager
  * re-implement ordering of the native dataobject (e.g. add a "SortWeight" CMS field for use in DataObject::get(NativeObject); )
  * _core_ - Apply "hinting" patches to make SQL builders more efficient & reliable.
