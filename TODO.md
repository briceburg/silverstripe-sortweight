# Silverstripe SortWeight Module TODO
  * Create up and down button (similar to existing top/bottom - but shifts up 1 or down one. Very useful when sorting objects in tables with multiple pages.
  * Improve configuration of updateCMSFields (e.g. to hide base object's SortWeight? field)
  * Use local distribution of jQuery-UI when included in core/sapphire (currently SS_DateField? uses Googleapis & thus so do we!)
  * Allow ordering in ModelAdmin? Search Results (apply Javascript Interface)
  * _core_ - Apply "hinting" patches to make SQL builders more efficient & reliable.
